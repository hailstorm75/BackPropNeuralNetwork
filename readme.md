# Description
This is a benchmarking program for neural networks. As of now, there is only one network available which is based on the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_PByyJ9g-I&t=972s. 

The benchmarker is still in development, however the NN is good to go and can be used independently. It comes with a C# facade, so it is simple to integrate with C# code.

Any suggestions and/or contributions are more than welcome. To post a question or suggestion please use the **Issues page**, create an issue and label it appropriately.
