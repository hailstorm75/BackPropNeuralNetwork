# Neural Network
This a NN which uses back propagation. The project core is based on the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_PByyJ9g-I&t=972s. The project's goal is to serve as an educational example of a neural network. This is mainly because of a deficit of clear and well-explained examples on this subject. Thus a working neural network is only half of the project. The other is the wiki, which has to explain both the code and the logic behind the neural network.

Any suggestions and/or contributions are more than welcome. To post a question or suggestion please use the **Issues page**, create an issue and label it appropriately.
